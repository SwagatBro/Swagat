<h2><strong>Hey Swagat,</strong></h2>

<b id="text">It hurts like hell that you're not here. You were more than just a classmate‚Äîyou were my brother, my best friend, my favorite person. School feels so empty now. Every place, every bench, every laugh now echoes with your absence. I miss you, man. Deeply.<br>

I'm sorry that I didn't know yesterday would be our last normal day together. If I did, I would've said so much more. But let‚Äôs not lose this bond. You're not gone from my life‚Äîyou‚Äôve just shifted lanes. We're still in this together.<br>

Please keep sending me reels, messages, anything. It‚Äôll make it feel like you‚Äôre still here beside me. School will be like hell without you, but your messages will bring a little light into it. And hey‚Äîif your number or Insta ID ever changes, let me know instantly. You‚Äôre still a part of my day, always.<br>

Now listen‚Äîno matter what, I promise you this: I‚Äôll complete our mission. Operation Sigma will live on. I‚Äôll carry it like a torch, as the lone soldier of Green House. And I won‚Äôt let us down. Every step I take will be for both of us. Our legacy won‚Äôt fade. <br />

But more than that, I want to share something with you. Life's not always going to be easy. But good habits will make you powerful: Be kind, stay consistent, respect people, and stay loyal to your roots. Work hard when no one's watching. Choose what‚Äôs right over what‚Äôs easy. And never stop dreaming‚Äîwe never did. <br />

You‚Äôve already made a mark on my life. Now go and make one on the world. And remember, we‚Äôre still bros. Always. <br />

<center>From the guy who will always have your back,  <br /> </center>
